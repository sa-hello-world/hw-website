                     SA "Hello World" has officially existed since June 27, 2016, but we've been organizing
                     cool activities for HBO-ICT students since March 2015! We started the association to
                     create stronger connections between students from all years, host fun events, and help
                     make your study experience smoother. Whether it's through social gatherings, academic support,
                     or just being a point of contact when you need it, we're here to make student life
                     more enjoyable and connected!
